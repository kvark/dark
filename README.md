Dark aims to be a practical lossless universal data compressor. By combining the security of [http://rust-lang.com](Rust) with the state of art BWT implementation and compression techniques, Dark aims to be the trust-worthy tool for your day-to-day compression needs.

It requires [http://github.com/alexcrichton/rust-compress](rust-compress), and is going to be developed in cooperation with this wonderful library.
